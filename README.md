# Shopping cart  
My first ever project with React and Material ui.  
Nothing fancy, but there are some interesting featured implemented such as: Theme changing, drag and drop...  
Later on a REST API had been created so that the shopping cart items wouldn't be hardcoded and instead fetched by a GET request.
